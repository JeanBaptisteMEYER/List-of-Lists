# Mistplay Android Challenge 2021
Solution by Jean-Baptiste Meyer

The Challenge: Create a vertical scrolling list of horizontally scrolling lists.
Mistplay supports this UI for displaying the games in separate categories.

The requirements for this mini project are to:
1) Build the functionality for the list of lists. Make sure to do this using Object-Oriented programming principles as well as design patterns.
2) Use the Kotlin programming language.
3) Incorporate the classes you build into a sample
application. This sample application can use any design you choose.
4) Well commented and formatted code.
